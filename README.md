# Microservices Pact Contract Testing Example

This repository demonstrates consumer-driven contract testing between two Node.js microservices using [Pact](https://docs.pact.io/):

- **Service A** (Consumer)
- **Service B** (Provider)

The project uses TypeScript, Jest, and Pact to ensure that the contract between the consumer and provider is always in sync.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install dependencies for both services:

```bash
cd service-a
npm install

cd ../service-b
npm install
```

### 2. Running Tests

#### Consumer (Service A)

Runs the consumer tests and generates Pact files:

```bash
cd service-a
npm test
```

Pact files will be generated in `service-a/pacts/`.

#### Provider (Service B)

Verifies the provider against the generated Pact files:

```bash
cd service-b
npm test
```

## Contract Testing Workflow

1. **Write Consumer Test:**  
   In `service-a/test/consumer.pact.spec.ts`, define the expected interactions with the provider.

2. **Generate Pact Files:**  
   Run the consumer tests in Service A. This produces Pact JSON files describing the contract.

3. **Publish Pact Files (Optional):**  
   If using a Pact Broker, publish the generated Pact files using the provided script.

4. **Verify Provider:**  
   In Service B, run the provider verification tests. These tests will fetch the Pact files and verify that Service B’s API matches the contract.

## Scripts

Each service defines the following npm scripts:

- `npm run build` – Compile TypeScript
- `npm start` – Build and run the service
- `npm test` – Run Jest tests (with Pact integration)

---

## Troubleshooting

- **TypeScript Errors:**  
  Make sure `ts-jest` and `ts-node` are installed and `jest.config.ts` is present in each service.

- **Contract Mismatches:**  
  If provider verification fails, check that the API responses match the contract generated by the consumer.

- **Pact Broker:**  
  If you use a Pact Broker, configure the broker URL in the provider test setup.
